# packet_sniffer

This tool is to be used together with the arp_spoof.py script. Firstly, run the arp_spoof.py script, then run this script. 

Also, this tool can only read http traffic and not https traffic, which most websites use nowadays. You can still use this tool to intercept credentials on sites like http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php

IMPORTANT! This tool is only for educational purposes only and is to be used with consent. Misuse of this tool can get you into serious trouble and I do not encourage illegal activities. Thank you.
